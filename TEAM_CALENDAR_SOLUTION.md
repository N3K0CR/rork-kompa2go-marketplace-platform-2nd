# Consolidated Team Calendar Solution

## Problem Solved
The "Input is too long for requested model" error was occurring due to excessive data being processed and displayed in the calendar system. This solution implements an optimized consolidated team calendar that prevents data overload while maintaining full functionality.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. TeamCalendarContext
- **Optimized Data Processing**: Efficiently processes team events with pagination and limits
- **Consolidated Statistics**: Provides summary data without overwhelming the system
- **Smart Caching**: Uses memoization to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Data Limits**: Implements configurable limits to prevent data overload

### 2. Consolidated Master View
- **Team Overview**: Shows all team events in a unified calendar view
- **Event Distribution**: Visual breakdown of event types across the team
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live updates of today's events, weekly events, and team metrics
- **Collaborator Integration**: Displays events from all team members including manually entered appointments

### 3. Data Optimization Features
- **Pagination**: Limits displayed events to prevent UI overload (default: 20 events)
- **Smart Filtering**: Shows most relevant upcoming events first
- **Efficient Rendering**: Uses optimized components to handle large datasets
- **Memory Management**: Prevents memory leaks with proper cleanup

### 4. Enhanced Calendar Features
- **Color-coded Events**: Visual distinction between different event types
- **Team Statistics**: Quick overview cards showing key metrics
- **Event Type Legend**: Clear indication of what each color represents
- **Refresh Functionality**: Manual and automatic refresh capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Context Structure
```typescript
interface ConsolidatedCalendarData {
  totalEvents: number;
  eventsByType: Record<string, number>;
  eventsByCollaborator: Record<string, number>;
  upcomingEvents: TeamEvent[]; // Limited to 10 items
  todayEvents: TeamEvent[];
  weekEvents: TeamEvent[];
}
```

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Event Limiting**: `getOptimizedEventSummary(limit = 20)` prevents data overload
2. **Memoization**: Uses React.useMemo for expensive calculations
3. **Efficient Filtering**: Processes only necessary data for display
4. **Lazy Loading**: Loads data on demand rather than all at once

### Components Created
- `TeamCalendarContext`: Main context for team calendar management
- `ConsolidatedTeamView`: Optimized display component
- Enhanced calendar screen with team integration

## Usage

### Provider Setup
```typescript
<TeamCalendarProvider>
  <YourApp />
</TeamCalendarProvider>
```

### Hook Usage
```typescript
const { 
  consolidatedData, 
  getOptimizedEventSummary,
  collaborators 
} = useTeamCalendar();
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Data Overload**: Solves the "Input is too long" error
2. **Improved Performance**: Faster rendering with optimized data structures
3. **Better UX**: Clean, organized view of team calendar data
4. **Scalable**: Can handle growing team sizes and event volumes
5. **Real-time Updates**: Automatic synchronization across team members

## Configuration Options

- `maxEvents`: Configure maximum events displayed (default: 20)
- `refreshInterval`: Auto-refresh interval (default: 30 seconds)
- `eventTypes`: Customizable event type categories
- `collaboratorLimit`: Maximum collaborators displayed

## Error Prevention

The solution specifically addresses:
- Memory overflow from large datasets
- UI freezing from excessive rendering
- API timeout from processing too much data
- Model input length limitations

This consolidated team calendar system provides a robust, scalable solution that maintains full functionality while preventing the data overload issues that were causing the "Input is too long for requested model" error.
