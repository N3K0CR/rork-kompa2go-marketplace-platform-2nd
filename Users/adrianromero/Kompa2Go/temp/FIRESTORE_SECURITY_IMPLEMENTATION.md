# Firestore Security Implementation

## ✅ Security Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Secure Firestore Rules

The Firestore security rules have been properly configured with the following protections:

#### ✅ Authentication Required
- All operations require user authentication via Firebase Auth
- No anonymous access allowed
- Helper function `isAuthenticated()` checks `request.auth != null`

#### ✅ Collection-Specific Rules

**Routes Collection:**
- ✅ Read: Any authenticated user can view routes
- ✅ Create: Only authenticated users can create routes with their own `driverId`
- ✅ Update/Delete: Only the route owner (matching `driverId`) can modify/delete

**Trips Collection:**
- ✅ Read: Only passengers or drivers involved in the trip can view it
- ✅ Create: Only authenticated users can create trips with their own `passengerId`
- ✅ Update: Both passenger and driver can update trip status
- ✅ Delete: Only the passenger can delete their trip request

**Users Collection:**
- ✅ Read: Users can only read their own profile
- ✅ Create/Update: Users can only create/update their own profile
- ✅ Delete: Disabled (users cannot delete their profiles)

**Statistics Collection:**
- ✅ Read: Any authenticated user can read statistics
- ✅ Write: Disabled (only backend can write via Admin SDK)

**Default Deny:**
- ✅ All other collections are denied by default
- ✅ No wildcard `allow read, write: if true` rule exists

### 2. Firebase Authentication Context

Created `FirebaseAuthContext.tsx` with:

#### ✅ Features Implemented:
- User authentication state management
- Sign in with email/password
- Sign up with email/password
- Sign out functionality
- Password reset via email
- Profile updates (display name, photo URL)
- Comprehensive error handling with Spanish translations
- Loading states
- Real-time auth state listener

#### ✅ Error Handling:
- Invalid email
- User disabled
- User not found
- Wrong password
- Email already in use
- Weak password
- Network errors
- Too many requests (rate limiting)

### 3. Firestore Service Layer

Created `firestore-service.ts` with:

#### ✅ Security Features:
- Authentication check before every operation
- User ID validation (users can only create/modify their own data)
- Proper error logging
- Type-safe interfaces for all data structures

#### ✅ Operations Implemented:
**Routes:**
- Create route (with owner validation)
- Update route
- Delete route
- Get single route
- Get multiple routes with query constraints
- Real-time subscription to routes

**Trips:**
- Create trip (with passenger validation)
- Update trip
- Delete trip
- Get single trip
- Get multiple trips with query constraints
- Real-time subscription to trips
- Get user trips (by passenger ID)
- Get driver trips (by driver ID)

### 4. Security Best Practices

#### ✅ Implemented:
1. **Authentication First**: All operations require authentication
2. **Ownership Validation**: Users can only modify their own data
3. **Least Privilege**: Users only have access to data they need
4. **No Wildcard Rules**: Removed development `allow read, write: if true`
5. **Explicit Denials**: Default deny for all unspecified collections
6. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and logging
8. **Audit Trail**: All operations logged with timestamps

### 5. Integration Requirements

To complete the security implementation, add the following to your app:

#### Step 1: Add FirebaseAuthProvider to Root Layout

```typescript
// app/_layout.tsx
import { FirebaseAuthProvider } from '@/contexts/FirebaseAuthContext';

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <FirebaseAuthProvider>
      {/* Your existing providers and components */}
    </FirebaseAuthProvider>
  );
}
```

#### Step 2: Use Authentication in Components

```typescript
import { useFirebaseAuth } from '@/contexts/FirebaseAuthContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, signIn, signOut, loading, error } = useFirebaseAuth();
  
  // Use authentication methods
}
```

#### Step 3: Use Firestore Service

```typescript
import { firestoreService } from '@/src/modules/commute/services/firestore-service';
import { where } from 'firebase/firestore';

// Create a route
const routeId = await firestoreService.createRoute({
  driverId: user.uid,
  origin: { latitude: 0, longitude: 0, address: 'Origin' },
  destination: { latitude: 1, longitude: 1, address: 'Destination' },
  departureTime: new Date(),
  availableSeats: 4,
  pricePerSeat: 50,
  status: 'active',
});

// Subscribe to routes
const unsubscribe = firestoreService.subscribeToRoutes(
  (routes) => {
    console.log('Routes updated:', routes);
  },
  [where('status', '==', 'active')]
);
```

### 6. Testing Checklist

#### ✅ Security Tests to Perform:

1. **Unauthenticated Access**
   - [ ] Verify unauthenticated users cannot read any data
   - [ ] Verify unauthenticated users cannot write any data

2. **Authenticated Access**
   - [ ] Verify authenticated users can read allowed data
   - [ ] Verify authenticated users can create their own data
   - [ ] Verify authenticated users cannot create data for others

3. **Ownership Validation**
   - [ ] Verify users can only update their own routes
   - [ ] Verify users can only delete their own routes
   - [ ] Verify users can only read their own user profile

4. **Trip Access**
   - [ ] Verify passengers can read their trips
   - [ ] Verify drivers can read their trips
   - [ ] Verify users cannot read other users' trips

5. **Statistics**
   - [ ] Verify users can read statistics
   - [ ] Verify users cannot write statistics

### 7. Deployment Instructions

#### Deploy Firestore Rules:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase (if not already done)
firebase init firestore

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

#### Verify Rules in Firebase Console:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Firestore Database
4. Click on "Rules" tab
5. Verify the rules match the content in `firestore.rules`

### 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

#### ✅ Recommendations:

1. **Enable Firestore Audit Logs**
   - Monitor all read/write operations
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity

2. **Regular Security Reviews**
   - Review rules quarterly
   - Update rules as features are added

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting in Firebase Functions
   - Monitor for abuse patterns

4. **Data Validation**
   - Add schema validation in rules
   - Validate data types and required fields

### 9. Additional Security Layers

#### Future Enhancements:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Add phone verification
   - Add email verification

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Add admin roles
   - Add moderator roles

3. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt sensitive fields
   - Use Cloud Functions for encryption

4. **IP Whitelisting**
   - Restrict access by IP (if applicable)
   - Use App Check for mobile apps

## Summary

✅ **All security requirements have been implemented:**
- Secure Firestore rules with authentication required
- No wildcard development rules
- Collection-specific access controls
- Firebase Authentication Context
- Firestore Service Layer with validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type-safe interfaces
- Audit logging

**Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

Deploy the Firestore rules using Firebase CLI and integrate the authentication context into your app layout.
